					Welcome, and thank you for accepting to be a guide for this new learning process. As a guide, you will be assigned learners to assist. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Your role, if you accept it, will be to help them better understand the tasks they have to do. You are expected to give them tips and explainers on the said task, not show them how to do the task. This way, what they learn will be deeper and will last longer. You can <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/pbl-research-learning-outcomes" title="Project Based Learning Research Learning Outcomes - Edutopia" target="_blank">read more</a> about this method of learning.
				</p>
				<p>
					There will be multiple projects and different learners, and we will match you with a project and a learner based on your previous works, and skill strengths. Each learner will know basic HTML, CSS and Object-Oriented JavaScript (or the language the project will be using), and they are tested using a quiz form (see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_idv_efMocGmaGmoK6a6Hczm9kLrNAKfYKUqnOW8MtsOZ_g/viewform?usp=sf_link" title="Newbie Developer's quiz form" target="_blank">form</a>), to be sure they meet this baseline. This will make it easier for them to pick up on whatever explanations you will give them. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Please note and document whatever you perceive during this process, to help us better improve this. You can drop your notes, findings and any comments you have <a href="http://bit.ly/lbd-feedback" title="feedback form" target="_blank">here</a>. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, you can read more about this program, access the list of projects, and the tasks for the newbie developers <a href="/" title="Home page - Learn by doing" target="_blank">here</a>.
