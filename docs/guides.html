					Welcome, and thank you for accepting to be a guide for this new learning process. As a guide, you will be assigned learners to assist. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Your role, if you accept it, will be to help them better understand the tasks they have to do. You are expected to give them tips and explainers on the said task, not show them how to do the task. This way, what they learn will be deeper and will last longer. You can <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/pbl-research-learning-outcomes" title="Project Based Learning Research Learning Outcomes - Edutopia" target="_blank">this article</a> to know more about this method of learning.
				</p>
				<p>
					There will be multiple projects and different learners, and we will match you with a project and a learner based on your previous works, and skill strengths. Each learner will know basics of the skills they are looking to learn.
					<ul>
						<li>
							New developers will know HTML, CSS, and basic object oriented programming in the language of their choice,
						</li>
						<li>
							Experienced developers will know basic product management,
						</li>
						<li>
							User interface designers will have worked on previous jobs, and just need more guidance to strengthen their colour, font, and other choices,
						</li>
						<li>
							User experience and newbie product designers will understand the basic processes needed to create engaging products, 
						</li>
						<li>
							Project managers will know how to manage projects, and basic Scrum/Agile principles. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					As stated above, the learners will have different roles, and so will the guides. Depending on your skill set and experience, you will be one of the following guides:
					<ul>
						<li>
							An experienced technical project manager, guiding a project manager with tips on how to create scope documents, create user stories, and manage a technical project.
						</li>
						<li>
							An experienced developer guiding a newbie developer with tips on how to write good code, follow best practices and use the right tools and principles when creating applications.
						</li>
						<li>
							An experienced product designer, guiding a user experience designer and a user interface designer to be more experienced as a user experience, user interface designer, and or a product designer.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					They are all apply using an application form, to be sure they meet this baseline. This will make it easier for them to pick up on whatever explanations you will give them. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As you guide learners through this process, you also learn more about your role and start advancing to the next skill level for your role. This especially applies to experienced software developers who start their product management journey, as they go through this process.
