					Welcome, and thank you for joining us as a project manager for this new learning process. This program was created to teach and introduce project managers on how to work on technical software projects, while applying Scrum project management principles (Agile principles). 
				</p>
				<p>
					Your role, should you choose to accept it, will be to work with a team and take them through a community project, by working with them from project brief to finished product.
				</p>
				<p>
					All members of your team are also in training to learn to be better at their chosen skill, by going through this project based curriculum. Your team will consist of: 
					<ol>
						<ul>
							An experienced software developer training to be product manager,
						</ul>
						<ul>
							A user experience or inexperienced product designer training to be an experienced user experience/product designer,
						</ul>
						<ul>
							A newbie software developer training to be an experienced software developer,
						</ul>
						<ul>
							A newbie user interface designer training to be an experienced user interface designer. 
						</ul>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
					Working with a client (the individual who submitted the idea for the community project you are working on), you will create a high level scope document. Using the scope document, you create an implementation plan for how you want to build out the features that make up the application/project. Based off the implementation plan youâ€™ll break the features into sprints (project iterations). At the beginning of each sprint, you will discuss over a call the work to be done in that sprint. You will do this in details with your team, and this includes the client. From this, you get the user stories and tasks, put them in a Kanban board as a to do task list (see <a href="https://github.com/devcenter-square/coding101/projects/2" target="_blank">here</a>), and assign them to individuals in your team, for them to be built out.  
				</p>
				<p>
					GitHub repositories, with their wikis, project boards and issue management will be used to house the documents, user stories and assign tasks. But to build these documents, you will use Google docs for collaborations, then transfer to GitHub. The experienced developer can help you with this. 
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are interested, please fill the form <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/IuzKy164K1zQXZtN2" title="Project Manager Details" target="_blank">here</a>. If you have already filled it, you can ignore it, and request for the project brief.
