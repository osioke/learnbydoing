					For a while, open source projects have been a developer (and more recently designers) way of learning new technologies, skills and techniques. By creating a solution or a tool using these new technologies, developers can learn in a free and friendly atmosphere. This has been the norm for a while, and <a href="http://tccl.rit.albany.edu/knilt/images/4/4d/PBL_Article.pdf" title="Project Based Learning|University at Albany">research</a> <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/pbl-research-learning-outcomes" title="Project Based Learning Research Learning Outcomes - Edutopia">has</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project-based_learning" title="Project Based Learning|Wikipedia">shown</a> that this method of learning helps students gain a deeper understanding of the subject, for a longer time than other traditional means of teaching.

					To help reduce the skills gap, and increase the quality of developers locally, we decided to create a process around it. Newly minted developers (newbie devs) will work on projects using specially designed tasks. And with the aid of guides, they will learn new technologies, skills and techniques in software development by doing.
